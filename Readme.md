node-despotify
==============
### NodeJS binding to libdespotify

## Deprecated! Don't use this module anymore. libdespotify no longer works. Take a look at [node-spotify-web](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-spotify-web) instead.

<del>This module wraps `libdespotify`, allowing you to conduct a Spotify session
programatically, doing things like searching for songs and artists, getting album
art, and even getting PCM audio data of the song currently playing!</del>
